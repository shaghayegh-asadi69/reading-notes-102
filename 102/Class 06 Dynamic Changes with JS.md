## What are variables in JavaScript?
>
> In JavaScript, variables are used to store and manipulate data. They are named containers that hold values, which can be of various types such as numbers, strings, booleans, objects, or even functions.

## What does it mean to declare a variables?
>
> Declaring a variable in JavaScript means creating a new variable and giving it a name. To declare a variable, you use the var, let, or const keyword, followed by the variable name. For example:

var age;  

let name;  

const PI = 3.14;

## What is an “assignment” operator, and what does it do?
>
>The var keyword is used to declare variables with function scope, whereas let and const are used to declare block-scoped variables. let allows reassigning the variable's value, while const creates a read-only variable that cannot be reassigned after it's declared.

An "assignment" operator in JavaScript is represented by the equals sign (=). It is used to assign a value to a variable. For example:

let num = 10;  

In this case, the value 10 is assigned to the variable num. The assignment operator can also be used to update the value of a variable:  

let num = 10;  

num = 20; // num is now 20  

## What is information received from the user called?
>
>The information received from the user is typically referred to as "input" or "user input." In JavaScript, you can obtain user input through various means, such as using the prompt() function to display a dialog box and collect user input, or by interacting with HTML form elements.
