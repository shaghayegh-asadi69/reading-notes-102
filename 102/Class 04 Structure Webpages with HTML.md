### **What is HTML and why do we use it?**

> HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used for creating the structure and content of web pages. HTML uses a set of tags to define and organize the various elements within a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. It provides a way to structure the content and define how it should be displayed in web browsers.

### **What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?**
> The three main parts of an HTML element are the opening tag, the content, and the closing tag. The opening tag indicates the start of an element and is enclosed in angle brackets (< >). The content is the actual text or media that the element represents. Lastly, the closing tag indicates the end of the element and is also enclosed in angle brackets, but with a forward slash before the tag name (</ >).

### **What is it called when you give an element extra information?**

> A semantic element in HTML is a tag that carries meaning or conveys the purpose of the content it surrounds. These elements provide descriptive information about the structure and context of the content, making it more meaningful and understandable for both humans and search engines. Examples of semantic elements in HTML include header, nav, section, article, footer, and others. Semantic elements enhance the accessibility, SEO, and overall organization of a web page.

### **What is a semantic element?**

> When you give an element extra information, it is referred to as an attribute. Attributes provide additional details or properties about an element. They are specified within the opening tag of an HTML element and consist of a name-value pair. For example, the href attribute in an anchor (<a>) element is used to specify the URL of the link.
