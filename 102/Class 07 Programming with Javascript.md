## What is control flow?
>
> Control flow refers to the order in which statements and instructions are executed in a program. It determines the path of execution based on conditions and allows the program to make decisions and perform different actions accordingly. Control flow statements in JavaScript include conditionals (if, else if, else), loops (for, while, do-while), and other flow control constructs.

## What is a JavaScript function?
>
> A JavaScript function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task or calculates a value. It encapsulates a set of instructions and can accept input (parameters) and produce output (return value). Functions in JavaScript are first-class citizens, which means they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as values from other functions.

## What does it mean to invoke - or call - a function?
>
> To invoke or call a function means to execute the code inside the function and perform its intended task. When a function is called, the program flow jumps to the function definition, executes the code within the function's body, and then returns back to the point where the function was called.

## What are the parenthesis () for when you define a function?
>
>The parentheses () are used when defining a function to specify the function's parameters. Parameters are placeholders for values that will be passed to the function when it is called. They allow the function to receive input and operate on it. The parameters are listed inside the parentheses, separated by commas. For example:

*function
addNumbers(a, b) {return a + b;  
}*

In this example, a and b are the parameters of the addNumbers function, which expects two values to be passed when calling the function.
