## What is an expression in JavaScript?
>
> In JavaScript, an expression is a piece of code that produces a value. It can be a combination of variables, operators, and function calls. Expressions can be as simple as a single variable or a literal value, or they can be complex involving multiple operations. For example, 3 + 4, x * y, and getName() are all expressions in JavaScript.

## Why would we use a loop in our code?

We use loops in our code when we want to repeat a block of code multiple times. Loops are useful for automating repetitive tasks, iterating over arrays or collections, and solving problems that require iteration. They help in reducing code duplication and increasing efficiency.

## When does a for loop stop executing?
>
> A for loop in JavaScript stops executing when the condition specified in the loop declaration becomes false. The loop consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and iteration. The condition is evaluated before each iteration, and if it evaluates to false, the loop stops executing, and the program flow continues to the next statement after the loop.

## How many times will a while loop execute?

The condition is evaluated before each iteration, and if it evaluates to false, the loop stops executing, and the program flow continues to the next statement after the loop.

For example, in the following for loop:

javascript  

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {  

  // code to be executed  

}  

The loop will execute as long as the condition i < 5 is true. Once i becomes equal to or greater than 5, the condition becomes false, and the loop terminates.
