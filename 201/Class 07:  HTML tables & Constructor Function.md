[Domain Modelling](https://github.com/codefellows/domain_modeling#domain-modeling)

## Explain why Domain Modelling is important

> Domain modeling is essential in software development because it helps us understand and represent the real-world problem or concept we are working with. By creating a model that captures the key entities, attributes, and relationships within a specific domain, we gain a clearer understanding of the problem space.

**Here are a few reasons why domain modeling is important:**

- *Shared Understanding:* Domain models provide a common language and visual representation that allows stakeholders, including developers, designers, and business analysts, to communicate and collaborate effectively. It ensures everyone involved has a shared understanding of the problem and its requirements.

- *Problem Abstraction:* Domain modeling allows us to abstract complex real-world problems into simplified representations. It helps identify the essential elements and relationships within the domain, making it easier to reason about and design solutions.

- *Requirements Clarification:* Through domain modeling, we can analyze and clarify the requirements of the system. It helps uncover potential ambiguities, gaps, or inconsistencies in the initial understanding of the problem, enabling us to refine and improve the requirements.

- *Design Guidance:* Domain models serve as a guide for system design and architecture. They help inform the structure and organization of the software, ensuring that it aligns with the underlying problem domain.

- *Code Quality and Maintainability:* With a clear domain model, developers can write code that reflects the problem domain more accurately. It leads to cleaner, more maintainable code that is easier to extend and modify as the system evolves.

In summary, domain modeling is crucial because it promotes shared understanding, helps clarify requirements, guides system design, and improves code quality. It enables developers to build software solutions that accurately represent and address real-world problems.

[HTML Table Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Basics)

## Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

> Tables should not be used for page layouts because they violate the principles of semantic HTML and can lead to accessibility and maintenance issues. Here are three reasons why tables should not be used for page layouts:

**Accessibility:** Tables are primarily intended for tabular data, such as data sets or comparative information. Screen readers and assistive technologies rely on the proper semantic structure of HTML to navigate and present content to users with disabilities. When tables are used for layout purposes, it can confuse assistive technologies and make it challenging for users to understand the content and navigate the page effectively.

**Maintainability:** Tables for layout tend to produce complex and rigid structures, making it difficult to update or modify the layout. Adding or removing elements within a table layout often requires modifying the table structure, which can result in significant changes to the HTML and CSS. This can lead to code duplication, decreased maintainability, and increased development time.

**Responsiveness:** Tables are not inherently responsive to different screen sizes and devices. When used for layout, tables often have fixed widths and may not adapt well to different screen sizes. This can result in horizontal scrolling or content being cut off on smaller screens, negatively impacting the user experience.

## List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>

Three different semantic HTML elements used within an HTML <table> are:

<thead>: This element represents the header section of a table. It is typically used to group the header content, such as column labels or titles. The <thead> element helps provide structure and context to the table data.

<tbody>: The <tbody> element represents the main body of the table, containing the actual data rows. It separates the header and footer sections and groups the table's content logically.

<th>: The <th> element defines a header cell within a table. It is used to represent the header or label for a column or row. The use of <th> instead of <td> for header cells helps convey the semantic meaning of the content and improves accessibility by associating the headers with their corresponding data cells.

[Introducing Constructors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics#introducing_constructors)

## What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

> A constructor is a special function in JavaScript that is used to create and initialize objects. It serves as a blueprint for creating multiple instances of objects with similar properties and behaviors. Constructors are typically defined using the class syntax or as regular functions.

Advantages of using constructors include:

- **Object Creation:** Constructors allow you to create multiple objects with the same structure and behavior quickly. By defining a constructor, you can easily create new instances of an object by invoking the constructor function with the new keyword.

- **Property Initialization:** Constructors provide a convenient way to initialize the properties of an object during its creation. You can pass arguments to the constructor function, which can be used to set the initial values of the object's properties.

- **Code Reusability:** Constructors promote code reusability by allowing you to define a blueprint once and create multiple instances of objects with the same structure and behavior. This can help reduce duplication of code and improve the maintainability of your codebase.

## How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

The usage of the this keyword differs between object literals and constructors:

- **Object Literal:** When used within an object literal, this refers to the current object. It allows you to access and modify properties and methods of the object itself. In this context, this represents the object that is being defined or accessed.

- **Constructor:** When used within a constructor, this refers to the newly created instance of the object. It represents the specific instance being created using the constructor function. Within the constructor, this is used to set the initial values of the instance's properties and bind methods to that particular instance.

In summary, this in an object literal refers to the current object, while this in a constructor refers to the specific instance being created.

[Object prototypes using a constructor](https://ui.dev/beginners-guide-to-javascript-prototype)

## Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy - edited the task for clarity and used ChatGPT to create the analogy (for the same reason!)

An analogy to understand prototypes and inheritance in JavaScript is by considering a family tree.

Imagine you have a family tree that represents different generations of your family. Each person in the family has certain characteristics and behaviors that they inherit from their ancestors. In this analogy:

**Prototypes:** Prototypes are like the ancestors in the family tree. They serve as the base or template for creating new instances. Just as each person inherits certain traits and characteristics from their ancestors, objects in JavaScript inherit properties and methods from their prototypes.

**Inheritance:** Inheritance is like the passing down of traits and characteristics from one generation to the next in a family. In JavaScript, inheritance allows objects to inherit properties and methods from their prototypes. When you create an object using a constructor or a prototype, it inherits the properties and methods defined in the prototype.

For example, let's say you have a prototype called "Person" that defines common properties like name and age, and methods like eat() and sleep(). Now, you can create multiple instances of "Person" using constructors, such as "John" and "Mary". These instances will inherit the properties and methods from the "Person" prototype.

In the family tree analogy, John and Mary inherit the common traits and characteristics defined by their ancestors. Similarly, in JavaScript, the instances created from a prototype inherit the properties and methods defined in that prototype.

This inheritance mechanism allows for code reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships between objects. You can define more specialized prototypes that inherit from a common prototype, creating a chain of prototypes and enabling objects to access and override inherited properties and methods as needed.

Overall, prototypes and inheritance in JavaScript provide a way to organize and share functionality among objects, similar to how traits and characteristics are passed down through generations in a family tree.
