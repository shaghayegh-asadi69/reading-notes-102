## To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?
>
> To create a basic link in HTML, we wrap the text or other content inside the <a> element.

## The href attribute contains what information?
>
>The href attribute of the <a> element contains the information or URL (Uniform Resource Locator) that the link should point to. This attribute specifies the destination of the link, which can be a web page, a file, or an anchor within the same page.

## What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?
>
> To ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers, we can consider the following approaches:

*Use descriptive text:* Instead of using generic phrases like "click here" or "read more," make the link text descriptive and meaningful. This helps users understand the purpose of the link even without the surrounding context.

*Provide alternative text for linked images:* If an image is used as a link, include the alt attribute to provide alternative text that describes the image. Screen read*ers can read this alternative text aloud, making the link accessible to visually impaired users.

*Ensure proper color contrast:* Make sure that the color of the link text contrasts well with the background color to ensure readability. This is especially important for users with visual impairments or color blindness.

*Use semantic HTML:* Structure your HTML properly by using semantic elements. For example, use heading elements (<h1>, <h2>, etc.) to provide a clear document outline and improve navigation for users relying on assistive technologies.

*Consider keyboard accessibility:* Ensure that links can be easily accessed and activated using a keyboard alone. This is important for users who rely on keyboard navigation instead of a mouse.

*Test with screen readers:* Test your website or web pages using screen reader software to identify any accessibility issues with links. This can help you understand how users with visual impairments or other disabilities experience your content.

By following these practices, you can make your links more accessible and inclusive for all users.

[CSS Layout: Positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Normal_Flow)

## What is meant by “normal flow”?
>
> "Normal flow" refers to the default positioning and layout behavior of elements in HTML and CSS. In normal flow, elements are rendered on the web page according to their position in the HTML document and the default styling rules applied to them.

## What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?
>
> Block-level elements:

Start on a new line and occupy the full width available.
Examples of block-level elements include <div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>, <ul>, <li>, and <section>.
They can contain other block-level and inline elements.

> Inline elements:

Do not start on a new line and occupy only the necessary width to display their content.
Examples of inline elements include <span>, <a>, <strong>, <em>, <img>, and <input>.
They do not force line breaks and can be placed within block-level elements.

## ___ positioning is the default for every html element

> "Static" positioning is the default for every HTML element. When an element is positioned statically, it follows the normal flow and is not affected by positioning properties such as top, bottom, left, or right. It is positioned based on its place in the HTML document flow.

## Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element

> Advantages of using absolute positioning on an element include:

**Precise control:** Absolute positioning allows you to precisely position an element relative to its containing parent or nearest positioned ancestor, using top, bottom, left, and right properties.

**Overlapping content:** Absolute positioning allows elements to overlap one another, which can be useful for creating complex layouts or layering elements.

**Z-index control:** Absolute positioning allows you to control the stacking order of elements using the z-index property. This is helpful when you want certain elements to appear in front of or behind other elements.

## What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

> A key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning is how they relate to the document's viewport:

**Absolute positioning:** When an element is positioned absolutely, it is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor, or if none exists, relative to the initial containing block, which is usually the document's viewport.

**Fixed positioning:** When an element is positioned fixed, it is positioned relative to the viewport itself and remains fixed in that position even when the page is scrolled. It does not move with scrolling, providing a "fixed" position on the screen regardless of the viewport's position.

## Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation
>
>A function declaration and a function invocation are two distinct concepts in programming:

**Function Declaration:**

A function declaration is the process of defining a function in the code. It specifies the name of the function, the parameters it accepts (if any), and the code block that is executed when the function is called.
It follows a specific syntax, such as:

function functionName(parameter1, parameter2) {
  // Code to be executed
}
The function declaration does not execute the function; it simply defines it for later use.
Function Invocation (or Function Call):

**A function invocation**, also known as a function call, is the act of executing a function that has been defined elsewhere in the code. It triggers the execution of the code inside the function's code block.
It typically involves specifying the name of the function, along with any required arguments, if the function expects any.
Function invocations are represented by placing parentheses () after the function name, optionally providing arguments inside the parentheses.
Example of a function invocation:

functionName(argument1, argument2);

## What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

**Parameter:**

A parameter is a variable listed in the function declaration. It acts as a placeholder or a "slot" to receive values when the function is called.
Parameters are defined within the parentheses of the function declaration and serve as local variables within the function's code block.
They help define the structure of the function and provide a way to pass data into the function.
Example:

function greet(name) {
  console.log('Hello, ' + name + '!');
}
In the above example, name is a parameter of the greet function.

**Argument:**

An argument, on the other hand, is the actual value passed or supplied to a function when it is invoked. It corresponds to the parameters defined in the function declaration.
Arguments are the concrete values that are assigned to the function's parameters.
They are specified inside the parentheses when invoking the function.
Example:

greet('John');

In this example, 'John' is an argument that is passed to the greet function, and it will be assigned to the name parameter within the function.

In summary, parameters are defined in the function declaration and act as placeholders for receiving values, while arguments are the actual values passed to a function when it is invoked.

**Increased Learning Opportunities:**
Pair programming provides an excellent opportunity for knowledge sharing and learning from one another. When two individuals collaborate on a coding task, they can share their expertise, insights, and different problem-solving approaches.

**Improved Problem Solving and Debugging:**
Pair programming can enhance problem-solving and debugging skills. When two people work together, they can tackle challenges collaboratively, bounce ideas off each other, and identify and rectify errors more effectively.
