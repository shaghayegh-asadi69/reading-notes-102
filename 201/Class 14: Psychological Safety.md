## What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?

- **Trust:** Psychological safety is built on a foundation of trust within the team. Team members need to feel that they can trust each other, share their thoughts and ideas without fear of judgment or negative repercussions, and rely on the support of their teammates.

- **Respectful Communication:** Open and respectful communication is essential for psychological safety. Team members should feel comfortable expressing their opinions, asking questions, and engaging in constructive discussions without the fear of being ridiculed or belittled. Respectful communication fosters an environment where everyone's ideas are valued and considered.

- **Supportive Environment:** Psychological safety thrives in a supportive environment where team members feel that they are not alone and have the support of their colleagues. It involves fostering a culture of empathy, understanding, and collaboration, where individuals can seek help, give feedback, and learn from each other without the fear of negative consequences.

## Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety

In my previous employment (Educational Leadership), I observed a significant lack of psychological safety which led to low morale, low staff retention and low levels of trust within the organisation.

Some of the major issues were:

- **Hierarchy and Power Dynamics:** The hierarchical nature of educational institutions create power dynamics that hinder psychological safety. Teachers often feel hesitant to voice their opinions or challenge established practices due to fear of retribution or negative consequences from superiors or colleagues.

- **Competitive Environment:** Since the introduction of performance related pay, the nature of the education system often fosters a competitive environment, where teachers may perceive their colleagues as rivals rather than collaborators. This competitive mindset can discourage open communication and trust, leading to a lack of psychological safety.

- **High Workload and Stress:** Teachers often face heavy workloads, time constraints, and stressful environments. These pressures can result in a focus on individual tasks rather than fostering a supportive and inclusive team culture. When teachers are overwhelmed, they may prioritize completing their own responsibilities over creating an environment of psychological safety.

- **Limited Resources and Support:** Inadequate resources, such as time, funding, and professional development opportunities, can contribute to a lack of psychological safety. When teachers feel unsupported and unable to access the necessary resources, they may hesitate to take risks or suggest innovative ideas.

- **Traditional Education Paradigm:** The traditional model of education, with its emphasis on authority and adherence to standardized approaches, can stifle creativity and experimentation. Teachers may feel discouraged from deviating from established methods, limiting their willingness to share ideas or challenge the status quo.

## What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?

- **Increased Innovation and Creativity:** Psychological safety encourages individuals to share their unique ideas, take risks, and think creatively.

- **Improved Collaboration and Team Performance:** Psychological safety enhances collaboration and teamwork. When team members trust each other and feel safe to communicate openly, they collaborate more effectively, leverage each other's strengths, and work towards common goals.

- **Enhanced Learning and Growth:** Psychological safety promotes a culture of continuous learning and growth. Team members feel comfortable seeking feedback, sharing their mistakes, and experimenting with new approaches which encourages personal and professional development among team members.

- **Higher Employee Engagement and Satisfaction:** When individuals feel psychologically safe in their team, they are more engaged and satisfied with their work. They experience a sense of belonging, which contributes to their overall well-being and job satisfaction. This, in turn, leads to higher employee retention and loyalty.

- **Positive Organizational Culture:** Teams that prioritize psychological safety contribute to building a positive organizational culture. As the culture of trust, respect, and support spreads, it influences other teams and creates a ripple effect throughout the company. This positive culture attracts top talent, fosters employee engagement, and contributes to long-term organizational success.
